wikipedia webscraper for events on today's date

Goal: 

  Create a script which takes information about the current day, important events from the day, and important births/deaths from the current
  day's wikipedia page. For example, december 25th would pull from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_25 and take items such as the following:

    336 – First documentary sign of Christmas celebration in Rome
    1066 - William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy is crowned king of England, at Westminster Abbey, London
    1950 – The Stone of Scone, traditional coronation stone of British monarchs, is taken from Westminster Abbey by Scottish nationalist students. It later turns up in       Scotland on April 11, 1951
    2021 – The James Webb Space Telescope is launched.
  
  and accordingly with deaths/births as well.
  
Potential Expansion:
  
  Add features such as today's weather, important dates recieving special treatment, features for hollidays
